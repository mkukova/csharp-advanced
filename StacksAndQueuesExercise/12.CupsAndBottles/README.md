## Problem 10.Problem 12.  \*Cups and Bottles

You will be given a **sequence of integers** – each indicating a **cup&#39;s capacity**. After that you will be given **another sequence of integers** – a **bottle**** with ****water** in it. Your job is to try to **fill up** all of the cups.

Filling is done by picking **exactly one** bottle at a time. You must start picking from **the last received bottle** and start filling from **the first entered cup**. If the current bottle has **N** water, you **give** the **first entered cup N** water and **reduce** its integer value by **N**.

When a cup&#39;s **integer value** reaches **0 or less** , it **gets removed**. It is **possible** that the current cup&#39;s value is **greater** than the current bottle&#39;s value. **In that case** you **pick bottles until** you reduce the cup&#39;s integer value to **0 or less**. If a bottle&#39;s value is **greater**** or equal to **the cup&#39;s** current **value, you fill up the cup and** the remaining water ****becomes wasted**. You should **keep track of the wasted litters of water** and **print it at the end of the program**.

If you **have managed** to **fill up all of the cups** , print the **remaining water bottles** , from the **last entered**** – to the first **, otherwise you must print the** remaining cups **, by** order of entrance **– from the** first entered – to the last**.

### Input

- On the **first line** of input you will receive the integers, representing the **cups&#39; capacity** , **separated** by a **single space**.
- On the **second line** of input you will receive the integers, representing the **filled**** bottles **,** separated **by a** single space**.

### Output

- On the first line of output you must print the remaining bottles, or the remaining cups, depending on the case you are in. Just **keep** the **orders of printing exactly as specified**.
  - **&quot;Bottles: {remainingBottles}&quot;** r **&quot;Cups: {remainingCups}&quot;**
- On the second line print the wasted litters of water in the following format: **&quot;**** Wasted litters of water: {wastedLittersOfWater}.**

### Constraints

- All of the given numbers will be valid integers in the range [1, 500].
- It is safe to assume that there will be **NO** case in which the water is **exactly as much** as the cups&#39; values, so that at the end there are no cups and no water in the bottles.
- Allowed time/memory: 100ms/16MB.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** | **Comment** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4 2 10 53 15 15 11 6  | Bottles: 3Wasted litters of water: 26 | We take the first entered cup and the last entered bottle, as it is described in the condition. 6 – 4 = 2 – we have 2 more so the wasted water becomes 2. 11 – 2 = 9 – again, it is more, so we add it to the previous amount, which is 2 and it becomes 11. 15 – 10 = 5 – wasted water becomes 16. 15 – 5 = 10 – wasted water becomes 26. We&#39;ve managed to fill up all of the cups, so we print the remaining bottles and the total amount of wasted water. |
