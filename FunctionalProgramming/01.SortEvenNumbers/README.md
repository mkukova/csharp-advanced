# 1.Lab: Functional Programming

1. 1.Sort Even Numbers

Write a program that reads one line of **integers** separated by **&quot;, &quot;**. Then prints the **even numbers** of that sequence **sorted** in **increasing** order.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |   | **Input** | **Output** |   | **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4, 2, 1, 3, 5, 7, 1, 4, 2, 12 | 2, 2, 4, 4, 12 | 1, 3, 5 |   | 2, 4, 6 | 2, 4, 6 |

### Hint

It is up to you what type of data structures you will use to solve this problem. Use functional programming filter and sort the collection of numbers.
