# Problem 1.Exercise: Streams, Files and Directories

1. Problem 3.Word Count

Write a program that reads a **list** of **words** from the file **words.txt** and finds **how**** many ****times** each of the words is **contained** in another file **text.txt**. Matching should be **case-insensitive**. Write the results in file **actualResults.txt**. **Sort** the words by **frequency** in **descending** order and then compare the result with the file **expectedResult.txt**. Use the **File** class.

# Problem 4.Examples

| **words.txt** | **text.txt** | **actualResult.txt** | **expectedResult.txt** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| quickisfault | -I was quick to judge him, but it wasn&#39;t his fault.-Is this some kind of joke?! Is it?-Quick, hide here. It is safer. | quick - 2is - 3fault - 1 | is - 3quick - 2fault - 1 |
