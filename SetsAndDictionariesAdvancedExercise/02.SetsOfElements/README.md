1. Problem 2.Sets of Elements

Write a program that prints a **set of elements**. On the first line you will receive two numbers - **n** and **m** , which represent the lengths of two separate sets. On the next **n** + **m** lines you will receive **n** numbers, which are the numbers in the **first** set, and **m** numbers, which are in the **second** set. Find all the **unique**** elements **that appear in** both of them **and** print **them in the order in which they appear in the** first **set -** n**.

**For example:**

Set with length n = 4: {1, **3** , **5** , 7}

Set with length m = 3: { **3** , 4, **5** }

Set that contains all the **elements** that repeat in **both**** sets **-\&gt; {** 3 **,** 5**}
