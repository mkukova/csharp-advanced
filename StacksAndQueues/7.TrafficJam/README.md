# 1.Lab: Stacks and Queues

1. 7.Traffic Jam

Create a program that simulates the **queue** that forms during a **traffic**** jam **. During a traffic jam only** N **cars can** pass **the crossroads when the** light ****goes**** green **. Then the program reads the** vehicles **that** arrive **one by one and** adds **them to the** queue **. When the light** goes ****green**** N **number of cars** pass **the crossroads and** for ****each** a **message**&quot;{car} passed!&quot; is displayed. When the &quot; **end**&quot; command is given, **terminate** the program and **display** a **message** with the **total**** number **of cars that** passed** the crossroads.

### Input

- On the **first**** line **you will receive** N** – the number of cars that can pass during a green light
- On the **next**** lines **, until the &quot;** end **&quot; command is given, you will receive** commands **– a** single ****string** , either a **car** or &quot; **green**&quot;

### Output

- Every time the &quot; **green**&quot; command is given, **print**** out **a message for** every ****car** that **passes** the crossroads in the format &quot;{car} passed!&quot;
- When the &quot; **end**&quot; command is given, **print**** out** a message in the format &quot;{number of cars} cars passed the crossroads.&quot;
