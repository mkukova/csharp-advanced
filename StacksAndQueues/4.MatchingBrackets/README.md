# 1.Lab: Stacks and Queues

1. 4.Matching Brackets

We are given an arithmetic expression with brackets. Scan through the string and extract each sub-expression.

Print the result back at the terminal.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 1 + (2 - (2 + 3) \* 4 / (3 + 1)) \* 5 | (2 + 3)(3 + 1)(2 - (2 + 3) \* 4 / (3 + 1)) |
| (2 + 3) - (2 + 3) | (2 + 3)(2 + 3) |

### Hints

- Scan through the expression searching for brackets
  - If you find an opening bracket, push the index into the stack
  - If you find a closing bracket pop the topmost element from the stack. This is the index of the opening bracket.
  - Use the current and the popped index to extract the sub-expression
