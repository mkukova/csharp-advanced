1. 5.Snake Moves

You are walking in the park and you encounter a snake! You are terrified, and you start running zig-zag, so the snake starts following you.

You have a task to visualize the snake&#39;s path in a square form. A **snake** is represented by **a string**. The **isle** is a **rectangular matrix of size NxM**. A snake starts going down from the **top-left corner** and slithers its way down. The first cell is filled with the first symbol of the snake, the second cell is filled with the second symbol, etc. The snake is as long as it takes in order to **fill the stairs completely** – if you reach the end of the string representing the snake, start again at the beginning. After you fill the matrix with the snake&#39;s path, you should print it.



### Input

- The input data should be read from the console. It consists of exactly two lines
- On the first line, you&#39;ll receive the **dimensions** of the stairs in format: **&quot;N M&quot;** , where **N** is the number of **rows** , and **M** is the number of **columns**. They&#39;ll be separated by a single space
- On the second line you&#39;ll receive the string representing the **snake**

### Output

- The output should be printed on the console. It should consist of **N lines**
- Each line should contain a string representing the respective row of the matrix

### Constraints

- The **dimensions** N and M of the matrix will be integers in the range [1 … 12]
- The **snake** will be a string with length in the range [1 … 20] and **will not contain any whitespace characters**
