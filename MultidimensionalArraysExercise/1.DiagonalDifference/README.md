1. 1.Diagonal Difference

Write a program that finds the **difference between the sums of the square matrix diagonals** (absolute value).

### Input

- On the **first line** , you are given the integer **N** – the size of the square matrix
- The next **N**  **lines** holds the values for **every row** – **N** numbers separated by a space

### Output

- Print **the absolute** difference between **the sums** of the primary and the secondary diagonal

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** | **Comments** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 311 2 44 5 610 8 -12 | 15 | **Primary diagonal:** sum = 11 + 5 + (-12) = 4 **Secondary diagonal:** sum = 4 + 5 + 10 = 19 **Difference:** |4 - 19| = 15 |
