#### There is a party in SoftUni. Many guests are invited and there are two types of them:  VIP and regular. When a guest comes, check if he/she exists in any of the two reservationlists.

#### All reservation numbers will be with the length of 8 chars.

#### All VIP numbers start with a digit.

#### First, you will be receiving the reservation numbers of the guests. You can also receive 2 possible commands:

- &quot;PARTY&quot; – after this command you will begin receiving the reservation numbers of the people, who actually came to the party.
- &quot;END&quot; –the party is over and you have to stop the program and print the appropriate output.

#### In the end, print the count of the quests who didn&#39;t come to the party and afterwards, print their reservation numbers. The VIP guests must be first.
