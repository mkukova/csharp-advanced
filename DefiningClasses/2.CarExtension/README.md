# Problem 1.Defining Classes - Lab


# Problem 3.Problem 2. Car Extension

**NOTE** : You need a **StartUp** class with the namespace **CarManufacturer**.

Create a class **Car** (you can use the class from the previous task)

The class should have private fields for:

- **make**** : **** string**
- **model**** : ****string**
- **year:**  **int**
- **fuelQuantity: double**
- **fuelConsumption: double**

The class should also have properties for:

- **Make**** : **** string**
- **Model**** : ****string**
- **Year:**  **int**
- **FuelQuantity: double**
- **FuelConsumption: double**

The class should also have methods for:

- **Drive(double distance): void**– this method checks if the car fuel quantity minus the distance multiplied by the car fuel consumption is bigger than zero. If it is remove from the fuel quantity the result of the multiplication between the distance and the fuel consumption. Otherwise write on the console the following message: ** **

**&quot;Not enough fuel to perform this trip!&quot;**

- **WhoAmI(): string**  **–** returns the following message:

**&quot;Make: {this.Make}\nModel: {this.Model}\nYear: {this.Year}\nFuel: {this.FuelQuantity:F2}L&quot;**
