# Problem 1.Exercises: Functional Programming

1. Problem 5.Applied Arithmetics

Write a program that executes some mathematical operations on a given collection. On the **first line** you are given **a list of numbers**. On the **next lines** you are passed **different commands** that you need to **apply to all the numbers** in the list:

- **&quot;add&quot;** -\&gt; add 1 to each number
- **&quot;multiply&quot;** -\&gt; multiply each number by 2
- **&quot;subtract&quot;** -\&gt; subtract 1 from each number
- **&quot;print&quot;** -\&gt; print the collection
- &quot; **end**&quot; -\&gt; ends the input

Use functions.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 1 2 3 4 5addaddprintend | 3 4 5 6 7 |
