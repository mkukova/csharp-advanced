# Problem 1.Exercises: Functional Programming


1. Problem 9.List of Predicates

Find all numbers in the range 1...N that are divisible by the numbers of a given sequence. On the first line, you will be given an integer **N** – which is the end of the range. On the second line, you will be given a sequence of integers which are the dividers. Use predicates/functions.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 101 1 1 2 | 2 4 6 8 10 |
| 1002 5 10 20 | 20 40 60 80 100 |
