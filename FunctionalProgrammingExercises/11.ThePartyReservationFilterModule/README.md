1. Problem 11.  Party Reservation Filter Module

You need to implement a filtering module to a party reservation software. First, to the Party Reservation Filter Module (PRFM for short) is **passed a list** with invitations. Next the PRFM receives a **sequence of commands** that specify whether you need to add or remove a given filter.

Each PRFM command is in the given format:

&quot; **{command;filter type;filter parameter}&quot;**

You can receive the following PRFM commands:

- &quot; **Add filter**&quot;
- &quot; **Remove filter**&quot;
- &quot; **Print**&quot;

The possible PRFM filter types are:

- &quot; **Starts with**&quot;
- &quot; **Ends with**&quot;
- &quot; **Length**&quot;
- &quot; **Contains**&quot;

All PRFM filter parameters will be a string (or an integer only for the &quot; **Length****&quot;**filter). Each command will be valid e.g. you won&#39;t be asked to remove a non-existent filter. The input will**end **with a &quot;** Print**&quot; command, after which you should print all the party-goers that are left after the filtration. See the examples below:

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| Pesho Misho SlavAdd filter;Starts with;PAdd filter;Starts with;MPrint | Slav |
| Pesho Misho JicaAdd filter;Starts with;PAdd filter;Starts with;MRemove filter;Starts with;MPrint | Misho Jica |
