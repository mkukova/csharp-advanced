# Problem 1.Exercises: Functional Programming

1. Problem 12.  TriFunction

Write a program that traverses a collection of names and returns the **first name,** whose sum of characters is **equal** to or **larger** than a given number **N,** which will be given on the first line. Use a function that **accepts another function** as one of its parameters. Start off by building a regular function to hold the basic logic of the program. Something along the lines of **Func\&lt;string, int, bool\&gt;**. Afterwards create your main function which should accept the first function as one of its parameters.
