1. 3.Word Count

Write a program that reads a list of words from the file **words.txt** and finds how many times each of the words is contained in another file **text.txt**. Matching should be **case-insensitive**.

The result should be written to another text file. Sort the words by frequency in descending order.

### Examples

| **words.txt** | **Input.txt** | **Output.txt** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| quickis fault  | -I was quick to judge him, but it wasn&#39;t his fault.-Is this some kind of joke?! Is it?-Quick, hide here…It is safer. | is - 3quick - 2fault - 1 |
